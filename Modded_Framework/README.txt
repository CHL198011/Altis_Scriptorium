This was the custom framework I was building, it is for MODDED ARMA only and requires CBA_A3 as a minimum. It is unfinished but has lots of working features so feel free to take things you like and add them to your own server, just keep appropriate credits in.
Furthermore, if your competent, you can try and finish the framework and have a truly custom experience for your server, or even better PR onto here and improve it for the general populance.
No SQM provided as I had not got to that point yet.

Dom_Code & Dom_Server would both be serverside, with Dom_Client & Dom_UI being client side. You'll need ExtDB3 and the Database1.ini is the SQL_Custom asset.
Any further questions, you can email me at domt602@gmail.com, but don't expect me to finish writing the framework for you.
