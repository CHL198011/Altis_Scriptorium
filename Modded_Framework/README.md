This was the custom framework I was building, it is for MODDED ARMA only and requires CBA_A3 as a minimum. It is unfinished but has lots of working features so feel free to take things you like and add them to your own server, just keep appropriate credits in.
Furthermore, if your competent, you can try and finish the framework and have a truly custom experience for your server, or even better PR onto here and improve it for the general populance.
A lot of changes are required depending on the map such as camera and dealer positions.

Dom_Server should be serverside, with Dom_UI being client side. You'll need ExtDB3 and the Database1.ini is the SQL_Custom asset.
A further PBO, D_C, is required for the medical system. It also provides various clothing you can use. Find D_C here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m7YFriM5mnrJNeNAq8Fpq_3EbayuMX3Q/view?usp=sharing.
Any further questions, you can email me at domt602@gmail.com, but don't expect me to finish writing the framework for you.
