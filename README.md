# Altis_Scriptorium

This repository will contain scripts primarily made for Altis Life (5.0), but some can be applied to a variety of gamemodes.
It will be split Vanilla & Modded ArmA, then down to standalone scripts and multi-scripts.
Everything here is open source, and can be used, all I ask is to leave the credits in the script, and possibly inform me your going to use them.
If you have any suggestions for any improvements or find any bugs, feel free to inform me ASAP.
