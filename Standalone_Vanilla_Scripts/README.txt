Scripts in here will be vanilla ArmA and standalone, meaning they can work on their own with little work put in. Each file has its own 'To-do' to help with getitng the file working.

fn_robStore is a robbery script which works by paying you out smaller amounts as the robbery continues, instead of a lump sum at the end.
The total attempts (ticks of being paid), total money, total time and the name of the store are defined via the NPC init line.
