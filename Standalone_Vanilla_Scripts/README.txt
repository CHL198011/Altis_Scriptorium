Scripts in here will be vanilla ArmA and standalone, meaning they can work on their own with little work put in. Each file has its own 'To-do' to help with getitng the file working.

fn_robStore is a robbery script which works by paying you out smaller amounts as the robbery continues, instead of a lump sum at the end.
The total attempts (ticks of being paid), total money, total time and the name of the store are defined via the NPC init line.

fn_tearGas is a script allowing you to use yellow smoke grenades as teargas, causing a blurred effect, as well as a camera shake effect and volume changes.
You can customise it by changing the values for each of the effects, check BIwiki for more info.

fn_vehicleGPS is a script allowing players to track vehicles, you can make it so they need an extra GPS (Vanilla A3 item) to be able to do this.
